# Amazon-Sales-Analysis
This project, Amazon Sales Analysis, focuses on analyzing and deriving insights from Amazon sales data using machine learning techniques. The project is divided into two main tasks:

Regression Analysis:
A Linear Regression model is built to predict discounted prices based on features such as actual price, discount percentage, ratings, and more.
The model achieves a high R-squared value of 0.95, explaining 95% of the variance in discounted prices.
Results are visualized using an Actual vs. Predicted plot to assess model performance.

Classification Analysis:
Products are categorized into "Most Selling," "Medium Selling," and "Lowest Selling" based on their rating counts.
A Random Forest Classifier is trained, achieving 100% accuracy on the test set.
A Confusion Matrix heatmap is used to visualize the model's performance.
